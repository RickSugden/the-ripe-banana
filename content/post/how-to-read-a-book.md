Before I even let you get to the second line, I will recommend you don't read "How to Read a Book" by Mortimer Adler and Charles Doren. I normally would prefer to say nothing at all rather than write a negative review so I will try to be concise. I will start with some of their general advice I will be using. I will then give my edited version of their strategy for how to read books along with my thoughts on it. Lastly I will discuss their suggestions on how to criticize a book. 

I've been a slow reader all my life. In grade school, I would see my friends reading gigantic fantasy novels and they would be turning the pages at a speed incomprehensible to my grade-four self. I remember feeling suspicious that someone could consume the information that fast... and a little frustrated that I certainly couldn't. Since those days, I still wonder whether I was just a sucker for wasting so much time when I should be "skimming" my readings -- whatever that means. This book helped me understand that different types and speeds of reading and when to employ each. 

Here is some generic advice:

* If the text is challenging, on the first read through, don't dwell on passages you don't understand. Keep moving and once you have an understanding of the greater picture, it will often make sense. A great example of when this would be useful is in reading Shakespeare. 
* Many people believe it is desirable to read faster, full stop. The authors argue that many people need to read certain texts slower, to allow for contemplation and absorption of the ideas. Other times, it may not even be necessary to read every word. Make sure you know what kind of book it is and pace accordingly.
* To read faster, don't read the words in your head, but rather scan over the sentence quickly and let your brain (spookily) determine the essence of the sentence. This works better than I thought it would.
* Also to improve speed, place a finger or thumb next to the line you're reading so your eye immediately goes to the correct spot on the next line. 
* For technical readings, invest in properly understanding the glossary.
* Avoids commentaries and wikis until you have made up your own mind.

This is a modified version of their strategy, picking, choosing and combining their ideas to fit this reading project. If you're studying a single or a few texts in depth, I'm confident you could find the unchanged strategy online.

1. determine what kind of book it is (novel, history, science, memoir etc.)
2. **Pigeonhole**: Spend the minimum amount of effort required to be able to summarize the author's argument in a sentence or two. To do this, read the title, the table of contents, sub headings, emphasized text and the index (the most overlooked). Confirm that you want to read this text.
3. **X-Ray**: Now that you have committed, write a list of the major parts of the books and how they relate to each other. 
4. Read the book from start to finish and jot down the arguments that fill in the outline you made for number 3.
5. Understand the "unity" of the book by asking what question the author was trying to solve with this book.
6. Evaluate their arguments to determine whether their overall conclusions are supported. Did they solve their problem?

I think that although their systematic approach would be excellent for extracting every drop of information from a single or a few books, I am not going to use it because I am trying to survey a lot of books to gain understanding of the world. This is not demanding of so much structure, but rather requires important ideas to be read understood rigorously and noted. When I make these notes, I try to condense the information as tightly as possible, because it forces me to have a high level of understanding (interestingly, some AI systems are based on this principle). 

What I found most interesting in this was not actually how to read a book, but rather how to criticize a book you've already read. Here's what they had to say:

For starters, do your best to not be "contentious". Not all books are written by philosophical scholars and if you are committed to finding a defect (however small) you will likely succeed and miss the point of the book.

More importantly, there are **only four** different ways of disagreeing with an author (philosophy majors may be familiar) you can claim that:

1. they are uninformed
2. they are misinformed
3. their logic is not sound
4. their analysis is incomplete

This is a simple yet powerful understanding of criticism. Having them categorized in this way invites the critical reader to be specific and think more deeply about their critical ideas. I am going to adopt this system in future blog posts. 

Although I am not adopting their strategy for this reading project, I
