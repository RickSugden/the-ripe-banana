Before I even let you get to the second line, I will recommend you don't read "How to Read a Book" by Mortimer Adler and Charles Doren. I normally would prefer to say nothing at all rather than write a negative review so I will try to be concise.

I've been a slow reader all my life. In grade school, I would see my friends reading gigantic fantasy novels and they would be turning the pages at a speed incomprehensible to my grade-four self. I remember feeling suspicious that someone could consume the information that fast... and a little frustrated that I certainly couldn't. Since those days, I still wonder whether I was just a sucker for wasting so much time when I should be "skimming" my readings -- whatever that means. This book helped me understand that different types and speeds of reading and when to employ each. 

 This book is exactly as advertised, it is an unusually thorough practical guide on how to read a book. It gives an overview of the different kinds of reading and the strategies that correspond to them, as well as some advice specific to select fields of study (I might address those in a later post). For me, the main problem with this book is that it contains too many precise arguments justifying claims that aren't central to the book's mission or value. Buried in the haystack of tangents, I was however able to achieve a few valuable tips and ideas to make for better, more efficient reading.

* Before investing time to reading the whole thing, spend the minimum amount required to be able to summarize the author's argument in a paragraph or so. To do this, read the title, the table of contents, sub headings, emphasized text and (if needed) the index. 
* Many people mistakenly desire to read all content faster. They argue, a majority is not  make sure you know what kind of book it is and pace accordingly.
* To read faster, don't read the words in your head, but rather read the sentence quickly and let your brain (spookily) determine the essence of the sentence. This works better than I thought it would.
* Also to improve speed, place a finger or thumb next to the line you're reading so your eye immediately goes to the correct spot on the next line.
