Before I even let you get to the second line, I will recommend you don't read "How to Read a Book" by Mortimer Adler and Charles Doren. I normally would prefer to say nothing at all rather than write a negative review so I will try to be concise.

I've been a slow reader all my life. In grade school, I would see my friends reading gigantic fantasy novels and they would be turning the pages at a speed incomprehensible to my grade-four self. I remember feeling suspicious that someone could consume the information that fast... and a little frustrated that I certainly couldn't. Since those days, I still wonder whether I was just a sucker for wasting so much time when I should be "skimming" my readings -- whatever that means. This book helped me understand that different types and speeds of reading and when to employ each. 

Here is some generic advice:

* If the text is challenging, on the first read through, don't dwell on passages you don't understand. Keep moving and once you have an understanding of the greater picture, it will often make sense. A great example of when this would be useful is in reading Shakespeare. 
* Many people believe it is desirable to read faster, full stop. The authors argue that many people need to read certain texts slower, to allow for contemplation and absorption of the ideas. Other times, it may not even be necessary to read every word. Make sure you know what kind of book it is and pace accordingly.
* To read faster, don't read the words in your head, but rather scan over the sentence quickly and let your brain (spookily) determine the essence of the sentence. This works better than I thought it would.
* Also to improve speed, place a finger or thumb next to the line you're reading so your eye immediately goes to the correct spot on the next line. 
* For technical readings, invest in properly understanding the glossary.
* Avoids commentaries and wikis until you have made up your own mind.

This is their strategy to approach reading (with my own modifications) if you need an in-depth understanding, for example to write an essay.

1. determine what kind of book it is (novel, history, science, memoir etc.)
2. Spend the minimum amount required to be able to summarize the author's argument in a sentence or two. To do this, read the title, the table of contents, sub headings, emphasized text and the index (the most overlooked). Confirm that you want to read this argument.
3. Now that you have committed, write a list of the major parts of the books and how they relate to each other. 
4. Read the book from start to finish and jot down the arguments that fill in the outline you made for number 3.
5. Understand the "unity" of the book by asking what question the author was trying to solve with this book.
6. Evaluate their arguments to determine whether their overall conclusions are supported. Did they solve their problem?
