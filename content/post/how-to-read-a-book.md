Before I even let you get to the second line, I will recommend you don't read "How to Read a Book" by Mortimer Adler and Charles Doren. 

I normally would prefer to say nothing at all rather than write a negative review so I will try to be concise. This book is exactly as advertised, it is an unusually thorough practical guide on how to read a book. It gives an overview of the different kinds of reading and the strategies that correspond to them, as well as some advice specific to select fields of study. For me, the main problem is that it contains too many precise arguments justifying claims that aren't central to the book's mission or value. Buried in the haystack of tangents, I was however able to achieve a few valuable tips and ideas to make for better or more efficient reading.
