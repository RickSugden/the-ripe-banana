### Thinking Fast and Slow

For my first real book selection, I have chosen a book that I think is a new fundamental part of my thinking that will come up again and again in future analyses: Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking Fast and Slow". In this post I will discuss some of the ideas I found most interesting and how I plan on applying them to my life. If you have not read it, I recommend every thinking person skim section one and carefully read the remaining four sections. For a brief sales pitch, see my goodreads review: [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3422865381](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3422865381 "Goodreads_thinking_fast_and_slow")

### **Notes**

This book reflects decades of psychology research so no summary will do the original justice because it is simply overflowing with useful knowledge. I have selected what I think are some of the most interesting ones along with how I intend to apply them to my life _in italics._ 

##### **Part 1:** 

* This part distinguishes Systems 1 and 2. 
* **System 1** is the fast, automatic, intuitive thinking that determines a picture of a screaming woman is angry. 
* **System 2** is the slow, deliberate, “logical” (has reasons) thinking that performs calculations or any other conscious thinking.

##### **Part 2: Heuristics and Biases**

* Consider a study of kidney cancer reveals its incidence is lowest in rural, sparsely populated areas. We naturally associate these as causes for the low rates. In reality, longer studies showed that the cause of this finding was simply that being in a sparsely populated area made it easier for sample variation to show a high or low amount. The interesting part is that the sparsely populated part probably did not immediately strike you as relevant. _Don't let your system 1 thinking discard information as irrelevant._
* It is believed that 40% of psychological studies have a negative result only because their sample size is too low and so they fail to achieve statistical significance. _Researchers ought to choose sample size with statistics, not intuition._
* Anchoring is a priming effect where someone is shown a number and presumes it to be reasonable, future negotiations and decision making now take that in account and tend to gravitate towards that. _Decide what you think is reasonable before hearing a salesman's opinion._
* **Availability bias:** things that come easily to mind are believed to be more likely. They mistake plausible for probable. Participants selected an earthquake causing an American tsunami to be greater odds than just an American tsunami. 
* Availability cascade (halo effect): proneness to thinking something is all good or all bad leading to incorrect extrapolation off initial information.
* Study participants read of a guy who would be a perfect candidate for a librarian. When guessing their profession, they failed to take into account that few males are librarians. _Don't forget base rates._
* Don't assume people will learn from stats, give them representative cases to help them understand. _I will try to implement this in any explanations._
* In a series of events, unlikely results are likely followed by one that will **revert to the mean**. A random number 0 to 100, 6 is achieved, next one is likely to be closer to mean 50). _Punishing poor performance is not as good as rewarding good performance. Reversion to the mean can provide an illusion that the opposite is true._

##### Part 3: Overconfidence

* Replacing human judgement with a formula is almost always a good idea. _Decide in advance what weight to give each factor (such as an application vs an interview) in a decision._
* You can only trust experts when they operate in a sufficiently predictable environment and when they are able to receive clear feedback quickly. _(That's not very many of them`)`_
* Entrepreneurs tend to have delusional confidence regarding their businesses because they can picture how it would succeed but its hard to picture the many ways it could fail (recall mistaking  plausible for probable). They also tend to neglect their competition. _Kahneman proposes a pre-mortem session strategy to prepare yourself for failure of a business instead of being blinded. Read chapter 24 for more details._
* Clinicians who were “absolutely certain” of a diagnosis were wrong 40% of the time. Experts who admit their uncertainty are more likely to lose business to competitors. _Don't seek out and choose bullshitters._

##### Part 4: Decision Making

* Expected utility value is not how people make decisions. Choosing between 
  1.  50% between 1 and 4 million dollars 
  2. certain 2 million dollars

  If your bank account is $1M or lower you'll likely double for certain whereas if it is $4M people prefer to take the gamble to keep their wealth. The first case shows us that _people are willing to pay a premium for certainty._
* When dealing with possible gains, people are risk averse and prefer the for sure option but when dealing with losses they are risk seeking and prefer to gamble. 

  **Losses register psychologically as twice the weight of an equal gain.**
* Kahneman gave a few multiple choice questions and was able to show that the average reader (including yours truly) would act according to a risk policy that flips and flops between sure gains and risk taking to avoid loss. He then showed a summary that showed my choices in each scenario led to the **lowest total expected outcome!** _His solution is that you should pick a risk policy and stick with it. If offered a coin toss of win 150 lose 100, if you always accept, then over the course of your life it will bring net benefit. Either always or never buy the extended warranty etc._
* People overweight highly improbable events and so:
  *  they become risk seeking when its a gain, potentially rejecting a favourable settlement. 
  * they become risk averse when the cost is high accepting an unfavourable settlement.
* The endowment effect states that people prefer things they already have. They randomly gave people a chocolate bar or a mug but majority did not want to trade for the other option.
* People putt better to avoid a bogey than to achieve a birdie.
* People avoid closing a “mental account” which results in a loss. They don’t want to end their shift until they made a days earnings. Cab drivers make more on rainy days so they clock out earlier and stay longer on sunny days when _you’d make more money doing the opposite._

##### Part 5: The Two Selves

* In part 5, Kahneman writes about how we remember things differently from how we actually experienced them leading to incorrectly (and detrimentally) reflecting on our lives. 
* In an experiment, people placed one hand in very cold water for a minute and the other in the same, and then moderately cold water for an extra 30 seconds. When asked which they'd prefer to repeat, they chose the later, **effectively volunteering the extra 30 seconds of discomfort.** This is because our minds register the intensity of the worst part and the ending with equal weight, greatly neglecting duration.

  _Most breakups are "like a symphony with a screeching sound at the end--the fact that it ended badly does not mean it was all bad._
* People rated a 60 year life of great joy to be more "desirable" than 60 years of great joy and 5 years of moderate joy. _Try to evaluate happiness in absolute terms not relative, taking into account duration. The best way to control happiness is to control your use of time so you can find more time to do things you like._
* People asked how many dates they had been on in the last month then how happy are they with their life correlated their answers. _Evaluating the big picture cannot be done in a single instance._
* **Nothing in life is as important as you think when you are thinking about it.**

  _A fancy car will only make you happy in relation to how much you think about your car. If it's something you don't think about often, it won't bring you much happiness._

### Reflections

This book has taught me so much about the way our minds take shortcuts and how those can lead to making ourselves less happy or successful than we ought to be. It taught me how to ground my confidence in probability to make the informed decision. Perhaps most importantly, it gave insight as to how we shortchange ourselves of life satisfaction just because of the way we reflect.
