My name is Rick, I'm a 4th year student at UWO studying biophysics. Because the quarantine and pandemic have afforded me some extra time I have been trying to keep busy with a bunch of side projects. I have started learning about AI, reading books, playing trumpet and growing banana trees (hence the website name). I figured I'm learning some interesting things along the way and it could be fun to share them on a website and hopefully meet cool people with their own unique interests.
