Hello! This is where I am going to be documenting my thoughts on what I have read. In this post I will briefly describe why I read, what I read and then go over my strategy for how I can make this series as useful to both me and to you!

**Why I read**

I will start off by admitting that I don't actually "like" reading. I think that this blog is actually evidence of that! If I enjoyed reading for the sake of it, I doubt I would feel the need to "capitalize" on the progress I make. Yet, for a guy who doesn't enjoy reading, I seem to do a lot of it (like a compulsive amount) so let me explain why.

When I think about why I read, I have four main reasons:

1. I want to understand the world. Usually, an author writes a book because they have something to tell us about the world. With non-fiction, this is often explicit. But even with fiction, most so-called "literature" are stories that capture something about the human condition.
2. Technical knowledge. Sometimes I read because someone is an expert on a technical subject, whether science, history, philosophy or whatever it may be, and reading their book happens to be an efficient way of gaining some of their expertise. This includes learning good arguments, important facts and explicit how-to material.
3. Discovering new things. When you are unfamiliar with a subject (or sometimes, completely unaware!) you are gaining exposure to breadth. If an author will offhandedly mention something that might really interest you and open up a whole new world for you to explore. It seems like whenever I finish a book, my reading list actually gets longer...
4. New ways of thinking. When an author writes a book, whether you agree with it or not, you are getting insight into how that author thinks. You see how they view the world and how they solve problems etc. I think of it like downloading another software onto your brain: you can now, and this is critical, **choose** to access that mode of thinking in your own life and problem solving. Having more modes means you will be better equipped for more problems.

**What I read**

When I was in high school I read almost exclusively fiction, although I didn't read all that much. I loved the profound ideas and philosophies that they were centered around and every time I read something I would be thinking about it for days afterwards. Now, I read mostly non-fiction because it is more efficient at achieving what I want out of my reading (see above). Here is a sample of some of the topics I read about in no particular order:

* History (world wars, science, language etc.)
* Business (startups, blogging, psychology)
* Philosophy (ethics, lifestyle)
* Memoirs
* Technology (AI, medicine, hackers, computers)

**Blog Format**

In order for both the reader (you) and the writer (me) to get the most of this project, this is the plan I've come up with:

I will summarize and review books in a particular order. This will allow me to use the vocabulary of previous books to discuss the content of later books. Because of this, I will try to start with the books that I find to be most fundamental in my understanding and then progress onto more niche and novel (pun intended) texts.

When I intend on using concepts later on, I will include them in a glossary of ideas for readers (and myself) to refer to as well as defining it the first time it comes up.

The first book I will cover is the book "How to Read a Book". This will cover some different strategies of reading and how you can optimize your reading to suit your goals. This will allow me to specify how I read each book and what strategies I implemented or would recommend for a particular book.

**Conclusion**

As I've mentioned, I don't like reading in the traditional sense, so I hope that this has explained my view on reading and maybe gives you a new perspective on why you should read! This summer I've been chugging through my book list and even started a book club with my friend Farshad (I'll make a post about that later). It's been very rewarding and I feel like I have learned a lot and grown as a person.
