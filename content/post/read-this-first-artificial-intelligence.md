### Artificial Intelligence

Hello! This is the first post in a series of where I will be documenting my journey of learning Machine Learning(ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this post I will briefly describe what ML/AI is and what it is used for. I will then give a quick rundown of what readers can expect the structure of the blog to look like.

##### What Is Artificial Intelligence?

I'm sure there are a variety of ways to define AI, but when I refer to it, I am specifically referring to the subset of computer programs that can _mimic_ intelligence by being trained. These computer programs are composed of artificial "neurons" arranged to mimic a simple "brain" structure. I will be referring primarily to the AIs that exist today and not to the futuristic doomsday device known as "General AI" (although, I may do a post on that, just for fun). To quote my good friend Madhav Singhal: 

> If one wants to philosophize about AI, then should be able write the code and do the math for it first.

As I am writing this, AI has been described as "Narrow AI". That is to say, it is generally very good but only at a very narrow task. For example, the program that is currently the world champion of the classic boardgame 

#####  Blog Layout

I do not think there is a satisfactory way of quickly summarizing how they work so for my first few posts I will be discussing the fundamentals of Machine Learning (as I understand them) so that my readers and I have a shared vocabulary and foundation from which we can explore more interesting things such as Machine Vision, Natural Language Processing etc.
