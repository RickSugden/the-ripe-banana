### Artificial Intelligence

Hello! This is the first post in a series of where I will be documenting my journey of learning Machine Learning(ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this post I will briefly describe what ML/AI is and what it is used for. I will then give a quick rundown of what readers can expect the structure of the blog to look like.

One of the first things in the field of AI that really caught my eye was this website my dad sent me last year:

[https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/](https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/ "https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/")

This website has a stock of many photographs of people's faces as well as many images of faces that it has generated. The people do not exist, the images are completely made up. Despite this, the game (i.e. determining which is real) is rather difficult for someone who has not studied the computer programming. I was shocked to discover that AI had come so far, in such a human, quasi-sacred domain.

Another really cool introduction to AI applications is the Netflix documentary on AlphaGO, a program that beat the world champion of the classic strategy game "go" which has long been thought of as a game too intuitive for a computer to understand. I will eventually return to this topic in a future post as computers playing strategy games fascinate me.

I could ramble on about the cool things going on in the world of AI but I should probably save that for after you guys have been introduced to the basics... So let's get our feet wet!

##### What Is Artificial Intelligence?

I'm sure there are a variety of ways to define AI (which is technically not the same as ML, but I'm not going to go into that), so when I refer to it, I am specifically referring to the subset of computer programs that can _mimic_ intelligence by being trained. These computer programs are composed of artificial "neurons" arranged to mimic a simple "brain" structure. I will be referring primarily to the AIs that exist today and not to the futuristic doomsday device known as "General AI" (although, I may do a post on that, just for fun). To quote my good friend Madhav Singhal: 

> If one wants to philosophize about AI, then should be able write the code and do the math for it first.

As I am writing this, AI has been described as "Narrow AI". That is to say, it is generally very good but only at a very narrow task. For example, recognizing bone fractures or classifying objects as cats. However, the technology is quickly improving and we are seeing more and more intelligent applications such as self driving cars, text interpretation and face recognition. 

#####  Blog Layout

Despite the attempts by clever diagrams, I do not think there is a satisfactory way of quickly summarizing how AIs work so for my first few posts I will be discussing the fundamentals of Machine Learning (as I understand them). This way, my blog will be accessible to anyone because my readers and I will have a shared foundation and vocabulary from which we can explore more interesting things such as Machine Vision, Natural Language Processing etc. 

Disclaimer: I am not an expert. I am not claiming that everything I post is the word of God. Instead, I encourage your feedback if I have made a mistake or even gotten something completely wrong! The whole point of this blog is so I can share what I'm learning in an accessible way and hopefully you guys can correct me, introduce me to cool resources, papers etc. so that I learn from you as well!

SO... the fundamentals posts are intended to be an introduction to the topic so you can understand later posts, I would still encourage you to learn from other sources too as I am going to avoid getting too bogged down in details and equations.

This summer (2020), I have been inspired by the which face is real game to learn about face-related AIs. I have been looking into the state-of-the-art architectures and what their capabilities are. Once we've covered the fundamentals,  my posts are going to be about sharing my notes and what I've learned about each architecture I've studied. For those of you who are familiar with my reading blog, these AI blogs will not be as structured. They will likely be my raw notes with about 20 minutes of polishing per post. The main objective is simply to make the somewhat technical papers more accessible.

##### Conclusion

I am really excited to share my learning journey with you guys and hope that you find it useful. I want to reiterate that I strongly encourage you to call BS whenever you see it. I am still very much so a beginner and would love feedback to help me solidify what I'm learning.
